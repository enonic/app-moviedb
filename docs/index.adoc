Hands on intro to our platform, CLI, Content Studio, headless API, and free hosting tier.

TIP: *Just looking for a demo?* - https://enonic.com/sign-up[Sign up for a free Enonic account^]. Create a new solution based on the `Movie DB` template to get a live demo using the same setup as this tutorial.  

== Introduction

This guide will show you how to:

* set up a local Enonic developer environment
* create an Enonic app
* install and use Content Studio
* customize the app by adding a new content type
* access and use the GraphQL API
* optionally - deploy your app to a live server

== Install CLI

The Enonic Command Line Interface is an essential tool for developers working with Enonic.

If you have `npm` on your device, run this command: 

  npm install -g @enonic/cli

If not, here are some https://developer.enonic.com/start[alternative ways to install Enonic CLI^]

To verify that the CLI has been installed, run `enonic -v`. This should output the version of your installed CLI. 

To see all available options, simply run `enonic`.

TIP: To upgrade, use `enonic latest`. If there are new versions you will see instructions on how to upgrade.


== Create a Sandbox

A sandbox is a local developer instance of our platform - Enonic XP. Create a sandbox by running this command in your terminal:

  enonic sandbox create

Give it a name, i.e. `intro`, and select the most recent version of Enonic XP from the list that appears.

Start the sandbox with this command:

  enonic sandbox start --dev

Select the `intro` sandbox from the list, and it will boot up in development mode.

TIP: Dev mode will automatically load changes in your code when developing.

== Create an app

Enonic apps are used to ship everything from content models, to code and platform extensions.

From a **new terminal window**, create your first Enonic app.

IMPORTANT: Use the default options when prompted.

  enonic project create -r app-moviedb

[TIP]
====
The command uses the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/movie-db[Movie DB^] app as a starter (template) for your app.
====

=== Project structure

The previous step created the folder `myproject`, you should now have an app structure, looking something like this:

.Selected files from the app code:
[source,files]
----
docs/ <1>
src/
 main/
  resources/
   import <2>
   site/
    content-types/ <3>
    x-data/ <4>
samples/ <5>
gradle.properties <6>
----

<1> The documentation you are reading now
<2> Movie DB content
<3> Content Types schemas are placed in this directory
<4> X-data schemas are placed here
<5> Code samples that will be used in this guide
<6> App settings and name

== Deploy the app

Assuming you did not change the default directory name `myproject/` when creating the app, build and deploy your app with the following commands: 

  cd myproject
  enonic project deploy

Select the `intro` sandbox from the list, and the app will use this from now on.

[NOTE]
====
Look for a line like this in the sandbox log to verify that the app has started:

  2019-04-09 13:40:40,765 INFO ... Application [com.example.myproject] installed successfully
====


== Install Content Studio

https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/content-studio[Content Studio^] is the editorial interface used to create and manage content. It is not a part of the core platform, but as you will see soon, it can easily be installed from https://market.enonic.com[Enonic Market^].

. **Open the sandbox admin**: http://localhost:8080/admin[http://localhost:8080/admin^] and click `Login without a user`. This will bring you to the Dashboard.
+
. **Open the Applications app** from the top right `XP menu -> Applications`.
+
image::xp-menu-applications.png["Go to Applications from the XP menu", width="319px"]
+
. **Install Content Studio**: click `Install` button in the menu bar, scroll down to `Content Studio` (or use search) in the list of apps that appears and click `Install` next to it. 
+
image::install-content-studio.png["Install the Content Studio app", width="760px"]

== Browse content

When your application was installed, it automatically created a Content Studio project called `Movie DB`, and imported sample content. Let's have a look:

. Open Content Studio, which is now available in `XP menu -> Content Studio`.

Select the `Movie DB` project when prompted, and you should now see the imported content.

image::content-studio-in-action.gif["Content Studio with Movie DB content", width="1024px"]


== Content type: Person

To edit an item, simply select it and click `Edit` in the menu bar, or by using right click. When editing a Person content item, this is what the form looks like in Content Studio. For bigger screens, you will also get a preview on the right hand side.

image::person.png["Person Form", width="1024px"]

The form definition comes from the content type definition, which is located within the app. Here is what it looks like.

./src/main/resources/site/content-type/person/person.xml
[source,XML]
----
include::{sourcedir}/src/main/resources/site/content-types/person/person.xml[]
----

=== X-Data: Social media

When editing a Person, the form contains an additional set of fields called `Social Media`. This is strictly speaking a separate form, injected into the Person content type - we call it an x-data. 

image::some.gif["Social Media x-data form", width="1024px"]

The cool thing about x-data is not the name, but the fact that it can be applied across multiple content types. In this app for instance, the Social Media form is also available on the `Movie` content. X-data can even be injected from a different application - at runtime.

This is what the definition looks like:

./src/main/resources/site/x-data/some/some.xml
[source,XML]
----
include::{sourcedir}/src/main/resources/site/x-data/SoMe/SoMe.xml[]
----

== Adding a new content type

Follow the steps below to add a `Review` content type to your app.

. *Copy or move the file* `samples/review/review.xml` to `src/main/resources/site/content-types/review/review.xml`.
. *Add an icon* by copying or moving the file `samples/review/review.svg` to the new content type folder as well. This will give your reviews a nice dice icon when seen in Content Studio.
. *Write a review*. Content Studio should pickup the changes immediately. Anywhere in the structure, click `New -> Review` and start writing.
+

== Graphql API

The https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/guillotine[headless API aka Guillotine^] - yes, we take headlessness seriously around here - is not part of the core platform. Like Content Studio, it can be installed from Enonic Market.

**Install the Guillotine app** from `XP menu -> Applications -> Install` and find it in the list of apps that appear.

TIP: The Guillotine API provides read-only-access to all of the content within the contextual project. Users requesting content will naturally only get access to the content he/she has read-permissions for. The Movie DB project is setup with public read access.

After installing Guillotine, Content Studio's left hand menu will reveal a new menu item called `Query Playground`. Here, you may test and play with the GraphQL API directly.

image::query-playground.png["Query Playground in action", width="1024px"]

The API documentation is available from the top left "file cabinet" icon. Use the dropdown on the top right to query against the draft or master branch, accessing the draft and published items respectively.

Want to know more about GraphQL in general? Visit the https://graphql.org[official GraphQL documentation^].


== Sample queries

Below are some example queries you can use for the Movie DB content.

=== Get Persons

.Get the display name of five items from `persons/` folder:
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
 guillotine {
  getChildren(key:"/persons" first:3){
    displayName
    _path
    }
  }
}
----

.Sample response:
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "getChildren": [
        {
          "displayName": "LÃ©a Seydoux",
          "_path": "/persons/lea-seydoux"
        },
        {
          "displayName": "Jeffrey Wright",
          "_path": "/persons/jeffrey-wright"
        },
        {
          "displayName": "Daniel Craig",
          "_path": "/persons/daniel-craig"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

=== Query variables

GraphQL also supports the concept of query variables. Similar to parameters in functions, you may pass variables to a query.

Query variables are defined with JSON. You can add them from the `Variables` option below the query editor.

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "path": "/persons"
}
----

With the variable set, update your query to use the variable. This query should provide the exact same response as it did before.

.The Person query, this time using path as a variable:
[source,GraphQL]
----
query($path:ID!){
 guillotine {
  getChildren(key:$path first:5){
    displayName
    _path
    }
  }
}
----



=== Movies and cast

NOTE: If you changed the name of your app when creating it, you must replace `com.example.myproject` and `com_example_myproject` for the query below to work.

.Get display name, and the cast of a movie:
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    query(query: "type='com.example.myproject:movie'", first: 1) {
      displayName
      ... on com_example_myproject_Movie {
        data {
          cast {
            actor {
              displayName
            }
            character
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

.Sample response
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "query": [
        {
          "displayName": "The Matrix",
          "data": {
            "cast": [
              {
                "actor": {
                  "displayName": "Keanu Reeves"
                },
                "character": "Neo"
              },
              {
                "actor": {
                  "displayName": "Carrie-Anne Moss"
                },
                "character": "Trinity"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

== Image handling

In this case, Guillotine plays tag-team with Enonic's image service, which is capable of delivering real-time cropped and optimized versions of images. In this case producing a 400 x 400px version of the image.

The query below show the name of actors containing the term `morgan`, and provide a link to a cropped image of the actor.

.Name of persons and a link to 400x400 scaled photo
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    query(query: "ngram('_allText', 'morgan') AND type='com.example.myproject:person'", first: 6) {
      ... on com_example_myproject_Person {
    	  displayName
        data {
          photos(first:1){
            ... on media_Image {
              imageUrl(type:absolute scale:"block(400,400)")
            }

          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

.Sample response
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "query": [
        {
          "displayName": "Morgan Freeman",
          "data": {
            "photos": [
              {
                "imageUrl": "http://localhost:8080/admin/site/preview/moviedb/draft/_/image/7ab1f76a-69a1-490f-b505-6eb6773c7cec:603726cc4fa712aa1b70c7eb64e1349f664494c3/block-400-400/morgan-freeman.jpg"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

When looking at the result in Query Playground, you can see the actual image by hovering over the link:

image::morgan-photo.png["Cropped version of Morgan Freemans image", width="1024px"]

The original higher resolution image is stored as a content item, just like persons and reviews. This is what it actually looks like:

image::morgan-original.png["The original version of Morgan Freemans photo is widescreen, with a red "autofocus" circle marked around his face", width="1024px"]

NOTE: The red "autofocus" circle, when set, helps the image service to crop the images optimally - as you can see from above.


== API endpoint
So far, you've been playing with the API via Content Studio, if you want to access the API's endpoint directly, its available at respectively 

* \http://localhost:8080/site/moviedb/draft (draft items)
* \http://localhost:8080/site/moviedb/master (published items).

The API can be deployed to a custom domain (aka vhost) when you go live. Also, important to notice - the GraphQL API is accessed via HTTP POST method, as such - visiting via a regular browser will render a 404.

TIP: The Chrome extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/altair-graphql-client/flnheeellpciglgpaodhkhmapeljopja[Altair^] lets you browse any GraphQL API, simply by pointing it to the URL.

== Deploying to Production

To deploy your application to production, you'll need Enonic XP running on a server. 

[TIP]
====
If you are looking for other hosting options, Enonic XP is open source, and https://developer.enonic.com/docs/hosting[can be deployed pretty much anywhere^].
====

. Start by **https://enonic.com/sign-up[signing up^]** for a free account. You must complete the verification steps before you can move on.
. Log in to the https://cloud.enonic.com[Enonic console^] , and **Create a new  solution** from the menu `Solutions -> CMS essentials template`. Complete the solution wizard steps using your preferences.
+
Similar to a sandbox, this will spin up an instance of Enonic XP, but this time as real server in the cloud.
+
. Once the solution has started, **authenticate the CLI** by running this command:
+
  enonic cloud login
+
After successfully authenticating, install your app using this command:
+
NOTE: You must execute the command from your app folder.
+  
  enonic cloud app install
+ 
Alternatively upload the app manually via `Enonic console -> <My solution> -> Applications -> Install`.
+
The app file is in your project folder i.e. `build/libs/<myproject>.jar`.
+
. **Expose your API** by creating a Route: `Enonic console -> <My solution> -> Routes -> Create`.
+
Give it a suitable name i.e. `Movie DB API`, and use the following values:
+
* Internal path: `/site/moviedb/master`
* Public path: `/api`
* ID provider: leave empty
+
. Tadaa! Your published content can now be queried directly on the URL created by this route.

== Dive deeper

ð Sweet! You made it to the end. 

In the process, you built and customized your own app, installed apps from Enonic Market, ran queries, got to know the Enonic CLI and our hosted offerings.

As you may imagine, the platform is capable of so much more. Did you for instance know Enonic has a https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework[JavaScript framework], will full https://www.npmjs.com/org/enonic-types^[TypeScript definitions^]. You may use it in your apps to extend and customize the platform as you like.

To continue the journey, we recommend visiting the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/tutorials[Enonic tutorials] section of the developer portal.

Bon voyage!
